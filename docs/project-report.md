# Project Report

## What We Made
A safe to-do app by Gerald, Jeascriel, Abiathar, Al Andrew, Jhon.

## How We Log In
- Google login with safe tokens.
- JWT codes to protect buttons.
- Roles: You control your tasks, bosses control all.

## Safety Locks
- **Lock 1**: Only right people see tasks.
- **No Tricks**: Safe from SQL and XSS.
- **Short Codes**: JWT lasts 1 hour.
- **Diary**: Tracks logins and tasks.

## Hard Parts
- Google login links were tricky, fixed URLs.
- JWT needed “Bearer” space.
- CSRF needed tokens.

## Done!
Our simple but safe app!
